"64. Other people would think I'm crazy if they knew what I was thinking most of the time.",
"65. Only by getting accurate information can you make a rational decision — but then, most people aren't really rational.",
"66. My family thinks that I am somewhat strange or eccentric — they've certainly told me that I need to get out more.",
"67. I can talk a blue streak when I want to; most of the time, though, I prefer to just watch all the craziness around me.",
"68. If you need a problem solved, let me work on it by myself, and I'll come up with the answer.",

"82. There are a few people I really look up to — they are sort of my heroes.",
"83. I don't like making big decisions, but I certainly don't want anyone else to make them for me!",
"84. Some people see me as jittery and nervous — but they don't know the half of it!",
"85. I know how much I mess up, so being suspicious of what others are up to just makes sense to me.",
"86. I want to trust people, but often find myself questioning their motives.",
"87. I am a real hard worker: I keep plodding along until the job gets done.",
"88. I sound out the opinions of people I trust before I have to make a big decision.",

"90. 'Anxiety' seems to be my middle name.",
"91. 1 love traveling and discovering different kinds of foods, people, and experiences — the whole fabulous whirlwind of life!",
"92. My calendar is usually full, and I like to keep it that way: no grass is going to grow under my feet!",
"93. What's important to me is excitement and variety rather than comfort and playing it safe — although I'll take my comforts wherever I can find them.",
"94. My mind is always chattering — sometimes it seems like I'm thinking about ten things at once!",
"95. One thing I absolutely cannot stand is being bored — and I make sure that I am never boring myself.",
"96. I'm pretty committed when I'm in a relationship, but when it's over, I move on.",
"97. I am curious and adventurous and am usually the first one of my friends to try whatever is new and interesting.",
"98. When I no longer enjoy doing something, I stop doing it.",
"99. I'm not just a 'fun person' — there is a serious, even darkside to me, although I do not like to go there very much.",
"100. I'm good at the big picture, not so much the little details: it's more enjoyable for me to brainstorm a lot of new ideas than to get involved with implementing them.",
"101. When I really want something, I usually find a way to get it.",
"102. Things get me down once in a while, but I quickly pop back up again.",
"103. One of my main problems is that I am easily distracted and can get too scattered.",
"104. I tend to spend more money than I probably should.",

"107. I feel that 'you have to break some eggs to make an omelet.'",
"108. When I care about people, I often begin to think of them as 'my people' and feel like I need to watch out for their interests.",
"109. I know how to get results: I know how to reward people and how to put pressure on them to get things done.",
"110. I do not have much sympathy for those who are weak and vacillating — weakness just invites trouble.",
"111. I am strong-willed and do not give up or back down easily.",
"112. I am never prouder than when I see someone I've taken under my wing make it on their own.",
"113. I have a tender, even somewhat sentimental side that I show to very few people.",
"114. People who know me appreciate the fact that I talk straight to them and tell them exactly what's on my mind.",
"115. I've had to work hard for everything I have — I think struggle is good because it toughens you up and makes you clear about what you want.",
"116. I see myself as a challenger, as someone who pushes people beyond their comfort zone to achieve their best.",
"117. My sense of humor is earthy, sometimes even crude, although I think most people are too prissy and thin-skinned.",
"118. I can get into a towering rage, but it blows over.",
"119. I feel most alive when I do what others think is impossible: I like to go to the edge and see if I can beat the odds.",
"120. Somebody usually has to come up on the short end of the stick, and I don't want it to be me.",
"121. What people seem to like about me is that they feel safe around me.",
"122. I don't mind being around people, and I don't mind being alone — either way is fine, as long as I'm at peace with myself.",
"123. I've found a certain balance in my life, and I see no reason to mess with it.",
"124. Being 'comfortable' in every sense of the word appeals to me a lot.",
"125. I would rather give someone else their way than create a scene.",
"126. I don't know exactly how I do it, but I don't let things get to me.",
"127. I'm pretty easy to please and usually feel that what I have is good enough for me.",
"128. I've been told that I seem distracted and absentminded — the fact is I understand things, but I just don't want to react to them.",
"129. I don't think I'm particularly stubborn, but people say that I can be hard-headed once I make up my mind.",
"130. Most people get themselves worked up too easily: I'm much more even-keeled.",
"131. You've got to take what life brings, since there's not much you can do about it anyway!",
"132. I can easily see different points of view, and I tend to agree with people more than I disagree with them.",
"133. I believe in emphasizing the positive rather than dwelling on the negative.",
"134. I have what might be called a philosophy of life that guides me and gives me a great deal of comfort in difficult times.",
"135. During the day, I do everything that needs to be done, but when the day is over, I really know how to relax and take it easy."];
